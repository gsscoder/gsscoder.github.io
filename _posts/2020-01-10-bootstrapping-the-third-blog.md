title: Bootstrapping the third blog
---

I used to have a [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) blog for years. It was my first blog, I had few projects on **CodePlex** (_now dismissed_) and used it mainly to notify updates. In that _glorious_ days was born a project that you may know if you're a **.NET developer**. The project is [Command Line Parser library](https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline), at the moment hosted inside a [GitHub](https://github.com/) organization.

The second blog, like this one, was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I admit things weren't easy like today, and with much ordinary work to do, I was too lazy to post articles. 

Anyway I've reposted articoles from second blog:

- [Compiler errors and decoupling]({% post_url 2013-03-05-compiler-errors-and-decoupling %})

- [Handling nulls]({% post_url 2013-03-25-handling-nulls %})

- [Discriminated Unions in C#]({% post_url 2013-04-23-discriminated-unions-in-c %})

Thanks to [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) I created my third blog in very few time and in a simple way.

Hoping to post more than in the past, I wish you good reading!
