I'm mainly a **.NET Developer** with a long experience in **C#**. I also develop in **F#**. Outside **.NET**, I like using **Python** and I've started studying **Go**.

I'm very interested in all **computer science** subjects, most of all **functional programming** and **software correctness**.

I'm based in Italy.
